			<h1>Research</h1>
            
            <p> What drives the development of an organism?  How do individual cells coordinate their motion to properly form tissues and organs? D'Arcy Thompson first questioned the forces that shape tissues.  His work was followed up by developmental biologists, but the emphasis was on genetics.  At this moment in history, we can investigate the physics of development - building on this wealth of genetic information and take advantage of state-of-the-art microscopy and laser microsurgery. My research focuses on the mechanics and signaling of cellular coordination.</p>
            
			<h2>Biomechanics of <em>Drosophila</em> Embryogenesis </h2>
                <p>
                Midway through <em>Drosophila</em> embryogenesis, two epidermal tissues dramatically untagle in a process that requires cellular coordination spanning the entire embryo.  We have found that this stage of development, called germband retraction, is mechanically robust to cell-level tension.  This finding suggests that during this stage, the embryo does not require careful regulation of force-producing genes.  Instead, cells coordinate their directed migration through their shape. Highly elongated cells in one tissue, the amnioserosa, are sufficient for successful retraction even with abnormal tensions among the cells.  Interestingly, these cells are elongated earlier in development â€“ serving as a store of morphological information that coordinates the forces needed for retraction. In this case, and perhaps more generally, cellular force strengths are less important than the carefully established cell shapes that direct them.

            <h2>Calcium signaling in <em>Drosophila</em> Wound Healing </h2>
				<p> When the epidermis is injured, undamaged cells surrounding
                the wound must coordinate their healing effort. Cells can
                communicate via calcium signaling, which is actively channeled
                away from the wound. In the <em>Drosophila</em> pupal notum,
                we have found this signaling occurs in a
                series of waves expanding and flaring several cells away. This
                signal then coordinates cell migration to fill the wounded region.
                </p>
                <p>
                I am modeling this process using a chemo-mechanical vertex model.
                Each cell in the model is represented as a 2D polygon with
                mechanically active components to allow migration. The mechanical
                forces are activated by chemical signaling among cells. Using this
                model, I hope to learn how cell communication coordinates cell
                migration.

			<h2>Experimental Microenvironment Testing Plant Root Branching in Complex Soil </h2>
				<p> Unlike animals, plants remain seditary after growth.  They must gather all of the nutrients for life from their local environment.  The root system has developed remarkable capability to adapt to changing soil conditions and optimize nutrient collection.  Strategic planning of the root architecture requires careful monitoring of the soil and coordination of cells that will develop lateral root structures.  I am investigating root cell communication via hormone signaling using a novel microenvironment. This microenvironment is composed of a microfluidic device that can control nutrient delivery along the primary root axis.  With spatial and temporal control of nutrients, I use fluorescence microscopy to visualize hormone response among cells.  I can then model cell communication by hormone signaling and learn how roots determine when and where to branch into lateral roots.

			<p>Development of living organisms requires coordination of cells. Viewed as a Collective Adaptive System, cells act as autonomous agents responding to stimuli from their neighbors and the environment to collectively produce an emergent behavior. We investigate the physical processes that coordinate these cells through the dynamic challenges of development. </p>
			<h2>Biomechanics of <em>Drosophila</em> Embryogenesis </h2>
				<img src="/assets/img/1T102040_t0_ChiChi_small.PNG" alt="2.5D Finite Element Model of Drosophila Embryo">			
				<p> In Drosophila, we analyze the biomechanics of epithelial morphogenesis in one stage of development, germband retraction. A 2.5-D cellular finite element model is used to determine the cumulative effect of all cells in a coherent epithelium. This analysis finds that embryogenesis is a mechanically robust process that is not dependent on any single group of differentiated cells, but rather is contingent on a cells maintaining developmental information through cell morphology.

			<h2>Experimental Microenvironment Testing Plant Root Branching in Complex Soil </h2>
				<img src="/assets/img/PlantInDevice_Small.png" alt="Arabidopsis Plant Growing in Microenvironment">
				<p> In Arabidopsis, cells coordinate to pattern root architecture, strategically investing resources for growth to conserve energy while optimizing nutrient acquisition. Root cells communicate with neighbors through auxin hormone signaling, sharing information about the changing soil environment. Global root architecture is hypothesized to be the emergent behavior of locally coupled non-linear feedback systems between cells responding to hormone signaling. We are testing this hypothesis both computationally with a mathematical hormone flux model and experimental using a microenvironment device. The microenvironment analyzes hormone response to precision-controlled nutrient delivery in microfluidic devices.
