			<h1>Research</h1>
			<p>Development of living organisms requires coordination of cells. Viewed as a Collective Adaptive System, cells act as autonomous agents responding to stimuli from their neighbors and the environment to collectively produce an emergent behavior. We investigate the physical processes that coordinate these cells through the dynamic challenges of development. </p>
			<h2>Biomechanics of <em>Drosophila</em> Embryogenesis </h2>

				<p> In Drosophila, we analyze the biomechanics of epithelial morphogenesis in one stage of development, germband retraction. A 2.5-D cellular finite element model is used to determine the cumulative effect of all cells in a coherent epithelium. This analysis finds that embryogenesis is a mechanically robust process that is not dependent on any single group of differentiated cells, but rather is contingent on a cells maintaining developmental information through cell morphology.

			<h2>Experimental Microenvironment Testing Plant Root Branching in Complex Soil </h2>
				<img src="/assets/img/PlantInDevice_Small.png" alt="Arabidopsis Plant Growing in Microenvironment">
				<p> In Arabidopsis, cells coordinate to pattern root architecture, strategically investing resources for growth to conserve energy while optimizing nutrient acquisition. Root cells communicate with neighbors through auxin hormone signaling, sharing information about the changing soil environment. Global root architecture is hypothesized to be the emergent behavior of locally coupled non-linear feedback systems between cells responding to hormone signaling. We are testing this hypothesis both computationally with a mathematical hormone flux model and experimental using a microenvironment device. The microenvironment analyzes hormone response to precision-controlled nutrient delivery in microfluidic devices.
