To Do

- Create a data science/analysis example
  - give an explanation FEM paper - detailing problem, metrics, constraints, results/what we learned
  
- Create an optimization/energy-minimization example
  - toy model of cellular potts 
    - just use energy min to spread points and make random cell sheet
    - assign different cell types
    - give very basic energy minimization function (don't worry about forces)
