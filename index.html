			<h1>W. Tyler McCleery, Ph.D.</h1>
			<h2>Postdoctoral Fellow</h2>
            <h3>Huston Laboratory, Physics, Vanderbilt University</h3>
				<p>I am a biophysicist studying multicellular coordination. I view organisms as collective adaptive systems – systems involving multiple tissues and cells that act autonomously, but work collectively to coordinate an organism-wide behavior. I am currently investigating epithelial tissue coordination in embryonic development and wound healing, as well as plant root branching in dynamic soil conditions. Specifically, I look at system dynamics, analyzing cell-level signaling and motility across whole embryos and roots. My research involves both experimental microscopy and laser microsurgery, as well as mathematical modeling. As an experimental and computational physicist, I collaborate closely with biologists and bioengineers. If you are interested in learning more or discussing potential collaborations, please contact me at tyler.mccleery@vanderbilt.edu</p>

			<h2>Physics, University of South Alabama</h2>
				<p>The McCleery Lab studies collective adaptive systems – biological systems involving multiple entities such as cells or tissues that act autonomously, but work collectively to coordinate an organism-wide behavior. Systems of interest include epithelial tissues coordinating embryonic development and plant root branching in dynamic soil conditions. Specifically, we investigate system dynamics, analyzing whole-systems as a collection of individual units. Out tool set includes confocal microscopy, laser microsurgery, time-lapse image analysis, and computational modeling.
