	<h1>Assistant Professor, University of South Alabama</h1>
	<p>I am a research scientist studying collective adaptive systems â€“ 
		systems involving multiple entities that act autonomously, 
		but work collectively to coordinate a system-wide behavior. 
		Examples of systems I have studied are both biological and robotic, 
		including epithelial tissues coordinating embryonic development, 
		plant root branching in dynamic soil conditions, and robotic swarms. 
		Specifically, I look at system dynamics, analyzing whole-systems as 
		a collection of individual units. As an experimental and 
		computational physicist, I am able to collaborate well across 
		disciplines. I specialize in experimental design and analysis 
		and computer modeling. My skill set includes confocal microscopy, 
		laser microsurgery, time-lapse image analysis, and computational 
		modeling in several coding languages. I am looking for opportunities 
		in systems analysis, especially involving multi-cellular or 
		multi-agent coordination. </p>
