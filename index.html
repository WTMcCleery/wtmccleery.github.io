			<h1>W. Tyler McCleery, Ph.D.</h1>
			<h2>Assistant Professor, University of South Alabama</h2>
				<p>I am a research scientist studying collective adaptive systems – systems involving multiple entities that act autonomously, but work collectively to coordinate a system-wide behavior. Examples of systems I have studied are both biological and robotic, including epithelial tissues coordinating embryonic development, plant root branching in dynamic soil conditions, and robotic swarms. Specifically, I look at system dynamics, analyzing whole-systems as a collection of individual units. As an experimental and computational physicist, I am able to collaborate well across disciplines. I specialize in experimental design and analysis and computer modeling. My skill set includes confocal microscopy, laser microsurgery, time-lapse image analysis, and computational modeling in several coding languages. I am looking for opportunities in systems analysis, especially involving multi-cellular or multi-agent coordination. </p>
