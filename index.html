				<p>I am a biophysicist studying multicellular coordination. I view organisms as collective adaptive systems – systems involving multiple tissues and cells that act autonomously, but work collectively to coordinate an organism-wide behavior. I am currently investigating epithelial tissue coordination in embryonic development and wound healing, as well as plant root branching in dynamic soil conditions. Specifically, I look at system dynamics, analyzing cell-level signaling and motility across whole embryos and roots. My research involves both experimental microscopy and laser microsurgery, as well as mathematical modeling. As an experimental and computational physicist, I collaborate closely with biologists and bioengineers.
